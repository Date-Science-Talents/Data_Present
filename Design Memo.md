# Design Memo

Because our project is not strong related with programming, we will not only upload our codes but also write our thoughts. So we decide to switch this README into a memo.

Here is the place to record our progress, thoughts, conclusions, and most important, growth.

Everyone, please feel free to write anything related to our project here~ÔºÅ Let's GitHub! We are GitHuber~!
